### Pathological-Voice-Detection
##### Voice-Pathology-Detection using the Tensorflow, Keras and Librosa library of python. Source_code.ipynb contains the required code for the given project  
##### I have used voice recordings of sustained sentence “Guten Morgen, wie geht es Ihnen?” (Good morning how are you) produced at normal pitch from German corpus Saarbruecken Voice Database (SVD). This corpus contains voice recordings and electroglottograph signals of more than 2000 speakers. The Idea behind this project is to Use Deep Neural Network on the feature extracted by Mel spectrogram generated on the raw speech signal to detect that the speaker’s voice is pathological or non-Pathological. The Trained model achieved 87.16% accuracy on the data of 726 Female pathological voice and 382 Female Healthy voice.
